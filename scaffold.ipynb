    "Educational data mining (EDM) is a field that focuses on applying data mining techniques to educational data for extracting valuable insights and improving educational outcomes. To find students at risk using EDM, you can follow the following process:\n",
    "1.\tData Collection: Gather relevant educational data from various sources, including student records, learning management systems, assessments, surveys, and demographic information. \n",
    "2.\tData Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing outliers. \n",
    "3.\tDefine At-Risk Criteria: Define the criteria or indicators that determine whether a student is considered at-risk in the educational context. \n",
    "4.\tFeature Engineering: Extract or engineer relevant features from the collected data that can capture the at-risk indicators. \n",
    "5.\tSplit the Data: Divide the preprocessed data into training and testing sets. \n",
    "6.\tModel Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning or data mining algorithm to build a predictive model. \n",
    "7.\tModel Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using suitable evaluation metrics.\n",
    "8.\tInterpretation and Analysis: Interpret the trained model to understand the importance of different features in predicting at-risk status. \n",
    "9.\tPredict At-Risk Students: Apply the trained model to predict the at-risk status for students in the testing set or new incoming students. \n",
    "10.\tIntervention and Support: Utilize the predictions to provide targeted interventions and support to at-risk students. \n",
    "Iteration and Improvement: Continuously iterate and refine the EDM process based on feedback, new data, and evaluation results.\n"
